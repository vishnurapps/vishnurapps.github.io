## Rank
- The rank of a tensor refers to the number of dimensions present within the tensor. 
- A tensor's rank tells us how many indexes are needed to refer to a specific element within the tensor.

## Axis of tensor
- An axis of a tensor is a specific dimension of a tensor.
- If we say that a tensor is a rank 2 tensor, we mean that the tensor has 2 dimensions, or equivalently, the tensor has two axes.

## Length of axis
- The length of each axis tells us how many indexes are available along each axis.

## Shape Of A Tensor
- The shape of a tensor gives us the length of each axis of the tensor.

## Reshape tensor
- Changes the number of elements in each axis
- Reshaping changes the shape but not the underlying data elements.
